        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Butterflied chicken</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Salt/li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200째C (400째F). Pat your chicken dry with paper towels and season liberally with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat one tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat in a large, oven-safe skillet until shimmering. 
            Place the chicken breast-side down in the pan and sear chicken without touching until skin is deep brown and crispy, about 8-10 minutes. 
            Flip chicken using tongs and cook the other side for about 5-10 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from pan, transfer to a plate, uncovered to ensure skin remains crispy. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, reduce heat to medium-low and 20 grams of butter. Melt until foamy and add the garlic. 
            Cook, stirring constantly, until very fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Switching to a whisk, slowly drizzle in milk while whisking constantly. 
            Once all of the milk is added continue whisking until it reaches a simmer.</li>
            <li>Return chicken to the skillet and move to the oven and finish cooking until done, or when an instant-read thermometer reads 74째C (165째F) when inserted into the thickest part of the breast, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and take the chicken out the pan and allow to rest while finishing sauce. 
            Return the skillet to medium-low heat and, whisking constantly, add butter one pat at a time, whisking until one pat is completely incorporated until adding another. 
            Sauce should be glossy and homogenous. Simmer for about 5 minutes further until slightly thickened and reduced.</li>
